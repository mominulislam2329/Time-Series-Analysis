### Exercise 2.2 b
Consider the data on US production of blue and gorgonzola cheeses in Table B.4.
  b. Take the first difference of the time series, then find the sample autocorrelation function and the variogram. What conclusions can you draw about the structure and behavior of the time series?


Answer: 
It seems that the trend is non-stationary for the US production of blue and gorgonzola cheeses.

### Exercise 2.11
Reconsider the data on the number of airline miles flown in the United Kingdom from Exercise 2.10. Take the natural logarithm of the data and plot this new time series.
  a. What impact has the log transformation had on the time series?
  b. Find the autocorrelation function for this time series.
  c. Interpret the sample autocorrelation function.

Answer: 
It seems that the trend is non-stationary having seasonal variation for the number of airline miles flown in the United Kingdom.
